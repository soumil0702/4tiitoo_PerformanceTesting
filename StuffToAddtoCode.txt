Show legend of plot, maybe the graph is showing values at the point of touching instead of showing small vals
Maybe at the end of compiling average stats also add actual memo consumption from the percentage and to a bytes2Human
Subtract avg. load of the temp.exe itself from overall load
If the script takes ages to start disable Quick Edit mode from the cmd defaults


Bugs:
Add a stopwatch or sth. similar maybe?
Get peaks of graphs, and annotate those vals
Get a report card from performance metrics
Make it possible to track a particular process maybe? or get the top 3 highest cpu eating processes?
2. The exe is taking ages to start (until i press enter sometimes it doesn't even start for 3 mins). could be due to multiproc command?

Update on threading: now its working pretty fast actually....why (despite the 1s interval) ???
Ans. I added the join method because this makes the length of all arrays equal. for some reason.....see if wpr also has 0 cpu load at 
some samples, and also compare it with without the join() method to see if things change (for this youll have to uncomment the time.sleep func
and comment the join lines, and make the intervals of the two cpu funcs to 1......also check if overall cpu func is logging right stuff (tally with
wpa if the vals dont make no sense from the task manager)
